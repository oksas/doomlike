# doomlike

A small data scraping and visualization project. The data in question is metadata on posts and likes on a very active thread on Doomworld. As of the time of last updating this text, only the scraped data has been saved; no visualizations have yet been made, but I intend to do so with React + vx most likely.

## Notes to self

Here are some visualizations to explore:
* total likes
* total posts
* likes/post ratio
* anything else we can do with this limited data?
